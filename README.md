## Project brief

You have been hired as an automation engineer for this project. They haven’t got any automation in place and are keen to hear your thoughts/approaches on tackling this project. In this exercise, you don’t have to write all the tests you would- it is just important to note down any ideas, blockers or recommendations you have. 

This test project is still small but has some key pieces of functionality. These are 

- A users page 
- Ability to see which users are active 
- Ability to search the users by username 
- Ability to delete users 
- Ability to favourite navigation items

We want to ensure that this functionality stays consistent so we are looking to add automated testing to the project. 

Other considerations 

- We have multiple clients, so data and configurations are likely to change. 
- This system may need to support over 10,000 users 
- We do not specify a minimum spec for our users environment or browser
